# This code is a simple Python script that uses the Flask framework to create a basic web application.
# This line imports the Flask class from the flask module. Flask is a lightweight web application framework for Python.
from flask import Flask

# Here, we create an instance of the Flask class and pass __name__ as an argument. The __name__ variable is a special Python variable that represents the name of the current module. This is used by Flask to determine the root path of the application.
app = Flask(__name__)

# This code defines a route / using the @app.route() decorator. When a request is made to the root URL of the application (/), Flask will invoke the hello() function. This function returns the string 'Hello, world!', which will be sent as the response to the client.
@app.route('/')
def hello():
    return 'Hello, world!'

# This conditional statement ensures that the Flask web server (app.run()) is only started if the script is executed directly (not imported as a module). When you run this script from the command line, Flask starts a development server on your local machine, listening for incoming HTTP requests on the default port (usually 5000).
