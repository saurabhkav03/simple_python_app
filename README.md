# AWS Continuous Integration Demo

## Set Up GitHub Repository

To start our CI journey, let's set up a GitHub repository to store our Python application's source code. Follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your GitHub account and go to github.com.
2. Click on the "+" button in the top-right corner and select "New repository."
3. Provide a name and an optional description for your repository.
4. Choose the visibility option that suits your needs.
5. Opt to initialize the repository with a README file.
6. Click on the "Create repository" button to create your new GitHub repository.

Now that our repository is set up, we can proceed to the next step.

## Create an AWS CodePipeline

Next, let's automate the continuous integration process for our Python application using AWS CodePipeline. Here's how to set it up:

1. Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the AWS CodePipeline service.
2. Click on the "Create pipeline" button.
3. Provide a name for your pipeline and click "Next."
4. Select "GitHub" as the source provider for the source stage.
5. Connect your GitHub account to AWS CodePipeline and choose your repository.
6. Select the branch you want to use.
7. For the build stage, choose "AWS CodeBuild" as the build provider.
8. Create a new CodeBuild project and configure it with your Python application's build settings.
9. Save the CodeBuild project settings and return to CodePipeline.
10. Continue configuring the pipeline stages, such as deploying your application with AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
11. Review the pipeline configuration and click "Create pipeline" to create your AWS CodePipeline.

Great! Our pipeline is now ready. Let's proceed to set up AWS CodeBuild.

## Configure AWS CodeBuild

Now, let's configure AWS CodeBuild to build and package our Python application. Follow these steps:

1. In the AWS Management Console, navigate to the AWS CodeBuild service.
2. Click on "Create build project."
3. Provide a name for your build project.
4. Choose "AWS CodePipeline" as the source provider.
5. Select the pipeline you created earlier.
6. Configure the build environment and commands according to your application's requirements.
7. Set up the artifacts configuration for deployment.
8. Review the build project settings and click "Create build project" to create your AWS CodeBuild project.

Fantastic! AWS CodeBuild is now configured. Let's move on to triggering the CI process.

## Trigger the CI Process

To trigger the CI process, follow these steps:

1. Make a change to your Python application's source code in your GitHub repository.
2. Commit and push your changes to the configured branch in AWS CodePipeline.
3. Navigate to your pipeline in the AWS CodePipeline console.
4. The pipeline will automatically start when it detects changes in your repository.
5. Sit back and relax while AWS CodePipeline fetches the latest code, triggers the build process with AWS CodeBuild, and deploys the application if configured.

Enjoy witnessing the magic of continuous integration in action!
